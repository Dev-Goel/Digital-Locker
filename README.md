## About the Project

Our project digital locker aims to build a digital lock that can be
unlocked by a 4 digit password. The user can input the password and
based on the input the locker will give a signal i.e., the locker led will
turn green if the password is correct and locker led will turn red if the
password is wrong.

## Features

2.) The red light will glow if the entered password is wrong.<br>
3.) The green light will glow if the entered password is correct<br>
